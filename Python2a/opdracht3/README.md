My first time working with timestamps in a sequencer. The user can insert 
a bpm and the sequence will play. I would like to upgrade the sequencer 
with some more user input and playing different samples. I used 
assignment_3 06_oneSampleSequenceTime.py by ciska vriezenga as help by 
writing the last part of my code (line 60-80). I tried it myself but couldn't
figure it out completly.
